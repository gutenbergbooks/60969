  <h2 class='c005'>FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In preparing this sketch of the 149th Regiment,
Ohio Volunteer Infantry, the author has
depended upon the memory of events that made
a lasting impression upon a young mind. He
does not claim to have written a full history of
this service, that is stored in the memories and
experiences of the different members of the Regiment.
He does claim, however, that the main
facts and movements of the Regiment and the
other bodies of troops associated with it in the
field, are accurate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The writer was fortunate in making a record
of dates and incidents, soon after his return,
which record has been invaluable in the preparation
of this sketch.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the little booklet will be interesting to my
comrades, or of any value in a historical way, I
shall feel amply repaid for the labor in preparing
it.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>Organization of the Hundred Days Service<a id='t13'></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The winter of 1863–4 on the banks of the
Rapidan was passed in preparation by both
Grant and Lee’s armies for that wrestle of giants
that was to begin in May in the wilderness
and end at Appomattox in the following April.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the southwest Sherman had won Missionary
Ridge and Chicamauga and was getting
ready for his Atlanta campaign, and a great
force was doing garrison duty at various points.
General Grant told the President that if he
could have thirty thousand new men to relieve
the veterans, he could capture Richmond and
push the war to an end during the summer. This
was a difficult proposition on account of resistance
to the draft, and the vigorous activity of
the Knights of the Golden Circle and the copperheads
in the North.</p>

<p class='c007'>President Lincoln, however, acting on the
suggestion, called to Washington for conference
the loyal Governors of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois
and Iowa. At this meeting Governor John
Brough of Ohio said he would furnish thirty
thousand men to serve for one hundred days.
Governor Morton of Indiana promised twenty-five
thousand. Governor Yates of Illinois twenty
thousand, and Stone of Iowa, ten thousand.
Governor Brough returned to Ohio, and at once
began active work.</p>

<p class='c007'>On April 23d he issued general order No. 12
calling the National Guard of Ohio into active
service for one hundred days, unless sooner discharged,
to rendezvous on Monday, May 2d,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>and to report on that day the number of men
present for duty. This call was responded to
with alacrity, reports coming in showing thirty-two
thousand present. The 27th Regiment of
Ross County reported five hundred and ninety-six
men.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Regiment had been organized under a
law passed in 1863, forming the Militia into
volunteer Companies and Regiments. The 27th
was enrolled with the following roster of officers:
Colonel, Allison L. Brown; Lt. Col., James H.
Haynes; Major, Ebenezer Rozelle; Adjutant,
Robert Larrimore; Quartermaster, D. C. Anderson.</p>

<p class='c007'>The North had suffered an enormous drain
upon her resources, had seen her men sent home
from the front, suffering from disease and
wounds, pitiful survivors of battles in which
thousands had gone down to death. The romance
and glamor of war had gone, the horror
of it remained. There was scarcely a family in
the North who did not suffer sorrow that cannot
be described, hardly a fireside that did not
mourn for a husband or lover, brother or friend,
who went forth with pride, never to return.
Under such circumstances the men of the hundred
days service, knowing just what to expect,
hastily arranged their affairs, and from the
stores, work-shops and farms, flocked to the defence
of their country in the hour of its direst
need.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Wednesday, May 4th, the 27th Regiment
O. N. G. reported at Camp Dennison. It was a
cold, disagreeable day. Snow fell that afternoon,
a day on which men would rather have
remained by their own fireside, but a firm determination
of duty urged them on.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was found necessary now to have a reconstruction
of the Regiments and Battalions. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>eight companies of the 27th were by consolidation
reduced to seven. Three companies of the
55th Battalion from Clinton County were added,
making ten companies. By orders, the Lieut.
Colonel and Adjutant were relieved, and returned
to their homes. The Regiment entered
the United States service as the 149th Ohio
Volunteer Infantry.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the organization of the National Guard,
it was generally understood that it was for state
service only. The call for active service came at
a time when to go entailed great personal sacrifice
of business interests on the part of its members.
Farmers with scarcity of help, turned
over their work to their wives, who in this time
of emergency proved themselves helpmeets indeed,
carrying the business of the season thru.
A few of the members of the Guard were discontented,
and by the help of Southern sympathizers,
endeavored to fan this sentiment into a
flame, and to induce the men to refuse to enter
the service. However, to the credit of the men,
after an address, delivered by Governor Brough
at Camp Dennison, only one Company of the
Guard refused to go, and they were promptly
and dishonorably mustered out. The officers of
the 149th O. V. I. as re-organized were as follows:
Colonel, Allison L. Brown; Lieut. Colonel,
Owen West; Major, E. Rozelle; Adjutant,
T. Q. Hildebrant; Q. M., D. C. Anderson; Surgeon,
W. A. Brown; Assistant Surgeon, B. F.
Miesse; Chaplain, W. Morris. Non-commissioned
staff: Sgt. Major, George L. Wolfe;
Quartermaster Sgt., Austin H. Brown; Commissary
Sgt., Edward F. Beall; Hospital Steward,
James F. Sproat.</p>

<p class='c007'>From May 4th until the 11th the Regiment
remained at Camp Dennison, during which time
they were uniformed, armed and equipped, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>mustered into the United States service. On the
night of May 11th orders came for the Regiment
to report to Gen. Lew Wallace at Baltimore, Md.,
going by way of Columbus and Pittsburg. We
started at midnight, being crowded into box cars,
without a seat or bed except the floor. We rode
in this manner for three days and four nights.
Thursday noon found us still south of Xenia,
and did not reach Pittsburg until Friday evening.
There the Regiment was handsomely received.
We marched to a hall where a bountiful
supper was provided for us by the loyal
ladies of that city. That supper to the tired,
hungry soldiers was an event long to be remembered.
The good people of Pittsburg fed every
Regiment that passed through, going or returning.
Early the next morning we passed Altoona,
Pa., and the great “Horse Shoe Bend.” At this
point one of the brakes on our car dropped to
the track as we were descending the steep mountain
grade; we could hear it “bump, bump,” on
the track, but luckily it held, or the history of
the 149th would have ended then and there.
Nothing could have prevented the train rolling
over the mountain side.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, the longest ride must have an
end. Our train pulled into Baltimore at 3
o’clock Sunday morning. As soon as possible
Col. Brown reported to General Wallace, and
the Regiment was assigned to duty at several
points in the city, relieving the 8th N. Y. Heavy
Artillery, Col. Porter commanding. Col. Porter
with his command, two thousand strong, immediately
left for the front, and after six weeks but
seven hundred remained, the Col. and all of his
staff being killed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Companies A and F 149th were assigned to
Fort No. 1 on the outskirts of Baltimore, Capt.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Wm. W. Peabody of Co. A being appointed
Garrison Commander.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between the days of May 4 and 16, 35,982
men, composing forty-one Regiments and one
Battalion, were consolidated, organized, mustered,
clothed, armed and turned over to the
United States military authorities for assignment.
The Guard was composed of the most
substantial men left in the state, men of every
department of trade, and of every profession.
Ohio had at that time sent ten per cent of her
entire population into the army. What a sacrifice
on the altar of the country was this great
outburst of patriotism.</p>

<p class='c007'>Companies A and F settled down to routine
garrison duty at Fort No. 1. Cooks were detailed
and the men assigned to barracks, Co. A
occupying the first floor and Co. F the second.
The duties of the day after roll call consisted of
dress parade and guard mounting. Guard duty,
was by detail, two hours on, and four hours off
each being held for duty twenty-four hours.
Time was given the men for many trips into the
city, and this part of our service was very pleasant
and safe. Many of our friends from Ohio
came to visit us while we were there and brought
money, and good things to eat for the boys.
Four Companies of the Regiment were assigned
to Fort Federal Hill, and Cos. D, K and I at
Headquarters in Baltimore. On May 25th several
companies were sent to the eastern shore of
Maryland, with Headquarters at Salisbury.
They had orders to quell the rebellion sympathizers,
and to do Provost guard duty at that point,
to guard the telegraph lines and to patrol the
Bay for smugglers. The author’s service being
with Company A, he is more conversant with
the movements of the Regiment in which that
Company took part. The memory of it all is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>dim. Like a dream in the night, it is misty and
seems to have occurred ages ago. We who were
just boys of from fifteen to eighteen years of
age at that time, are now the aged and broken
veterans, and the youngsters of today look upon
us, just as we used to think of the old Revolutionary
soldiers, when we were young. But we
were having too good a time in Baltimore for it
to last. The last opportunity we had to go down
town was on the evening of the 4th of July when
there was a grand display of fireworks.</p>

<p class='c007'>About this time we began to hear rumors of
Gen. Early’s invasion of Maryland and Pennsylvania,
and it was reported that he was marching
on toward Baltimore. He came within four
miles of the city and burned the residence of
Governor Bradford. In Baltimore the excitement
was intense. The bells of the city on that
Sunday morning called the citizens to man the
Forts, to dig ditches, and throw up earthworks,
instead of the church service, and thousands responded
to the all. Lieutenant Runkle of the
regulars assumed command at Fort No. 1 and
began a rigid drill in heavy artillery, our guns
were manned, loaded with shell and sighted at
prominent houses, groves, etc., that might give
shelter to the enemy. This drill was kept up for
two days and nights, the men sleeping at their
posts, expecting the ball to open at any moment.
But Early withdrew his forces and with haste,
again entered the Shenandoah Valley.</p>

<p class='c007'>On July 1st General Early received orders
to invade Maryland and advance on Washington.
He began preparations by forcing General
Siegel to retreat to Maryland Heights where he
was cooped up. Early moved by flank, entered
Maryland and advanced to Frederick City. On
the 9th of July the battle of Monocacy was
fought. We at Fort No. 1 began to see some of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>our soldiers come in from the battle field, among
them being Assistant Surgeon Miesse and Chaplain
Morris, who stopped at the Fort and gave
us an account of the battle. Gen. Wallace had
gathered a force of twenty-eight hundred men,
consisting of one Maryland Regiment and the
rest were hundred days men, among them being
the 144th Ohio, and seven companies of the
149th. On the 8th of July a brigade of Ricketts’
Division of the Sixth Corps came up on a train
of cars bound for Harper’s Ferry. Wallace informed
the Commander “that if he wanted to
get to Harper’s Ferry he would have to get the
consent of Jubal Early.” He stopped the Brigade
and put it in position. During the night
Ricketts came up with his other Brigade. He
wanted to know what Wallace proposed to do,
and was informed that he proposed to fight.
Ricketts laughed and said, “with my division
and your hundred day men you have only about
6,000. Do you expect to whip Early?” “No,”
replied Wallace, “but I propose to make him do
two things, develop his strength and whither he
is bound.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If bound for Washington he thought he
could delay him at least twenty-four hours, and
it would take him two more days to get to Washington,
and in that time Grant could get troops
from City Point in time to save the Capitol, but
without that Early would be in Washington
when there was not a man in the entrenchments.
Gen. Ricketts agreed with him, and his division
was placed. Colonel Brown was ordered to the
Stone Bridge over the Monocacy where the Frederick
and Baltimore turnpike crosses. His
orders were to hold the bridge at all hazards,
but if pressed too hard the men were to scatter
and save themselves the best they could. The
forces under Wallace numbered 5,500, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>those of Early were 23,000 of the pick of the
Confederate Armies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Long before daylight on July 9th the 149th
was in position at the bridge. They did not have
to wait long until Early’s troops were seen passing
through Frederick, bound for Washington.
Then came the tug of war. Gen. Wallace deployed
his men as skirmishers and attracted the
attention of the enemy, the object being to deceive
him as to the numbers opposing him. They
held him in check from daylight until late in the
afternoon. During the last hour the only force
opposing this veteran army of Earlys was the
149th Ohio. At four o’clock in the afternoon
Wallace seeing that his army would be either
captured or annihilated, ordered a retreat of all
but the 149th. This Regiment was to cover the
retreat, and to be sacrificed to save the rest of
the army. This was shown by the orders sent to
Col. Brown, which were as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>4:30 P. M., July 9th, 1864.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Colonel:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Major General Wallace directs me
to say that he directs that you hold
your position to the very last extremity,
and, when nothing more can be
done, that you fall back, and if
pressed, direct your men to disperse
and take care of themselves. This is
to be done when nothing more can be
done to retard the enemy’s progress.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Respectfully,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>E. B. Tyler,</div>
      <div class='line in16'>Brig. Gen.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Col. Brown was unaware of the retreat of
the rest of the army and was left alone in advance
of the stone bridge, beating back the repeated
attacks of the enemy until 5:30. At that
time a farmer living near informed him of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>retreat of the whole Union army except his Regiment,
and that they were a mile and a half away.
So he gave the order to retreat. Adjutant Hildebrand
was sent with three companies and deployed
as skirmishers on the left. They showed
such steadiness that Early stopped to reform his
lines, and behind this thin curtain of skirmishers
the Regiment cut its way through and escaped
to the north and toward Baltimore.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Col. Brown and his brave little army
overtook General Wallace, the latter was much
affected. He embraced him, the tears starting
from his eyes, and said, “Colonel, I never expected
to see you again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>General Grant in his report says “they
saved Washington.” The 149th in this engagement
lost 130 men in killed, wounded and prisoners.
The performance of the hundred days
men was a revelation to the old soldiers, and a
surprise to the enemy. They did not know when
they were whipped. Everywhere their duty was
well performed. On the long forced marches,
sometimes hundreds of miles with insufficient
rations, suffering from thirst, tramping the
dusty roads with blistered feet, it was all done
and suffered by the men cheerfully, and as well
as by the veterans of long service. I heard one
of the men of the 19th Corps say, “We have
served for three years but have never seen campaigning
like this.” Gen. Tyler in his official
report of the battle of Monocacy says:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It seldom falls to the lot of veterans
to be more tried than was the
Ohio National Guard at the stone
bridge, and none ever carried out trying
and hazardous orders better, or
with more determined spirit than did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the 149th Ohio, and the men associated
with it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The enemy had seized the time when Grant
had depleted the defensive forces of the Capitol,
to endeavor to capture Washington. Early
charged up to the very boundary of the city expecting
to find the rich prize an easy prey, but
the stubborn resistance of the Guard at Monocacy
and their vigilance in the forts at Washington
were more than a match for all the vaunted
dash and daring of his veterans, and he was compelled
to retire before the raw Militia of the
Buckeye State. This was a source of deep humiliation
to the dashing Rebel General which he
never got over to the day of his death. Whether
the hundred days man was on the alert in the
entrenchments of the capital, battling at the
front with the veteran forces of the Confederacy
or skirmishing on the lines of supply with the
wary foe in the rugged passes of the Alleghanies,
they were each in his place doing their duty
manfully toward the great and final victory
which came a few months later.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lincoln and Grant both said that the services
of the hundred days men shortened the
war, and, that the President appreciated their
service was shown by his issuing a special card
of thanks, a copy of which was sent to every man
in this service. This was a special favor from
the hand of our great war President, that no
other troops received, and one of which we can
well be proud. It was a tribute to bravery from
the great, noble heart of the kindest soul that
ever lived on earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gen. J. B. Gordon of the Confederate army
whose division was with Early in the fight at
Monocacy, says:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The battle of Monocacy was short, decisive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>and bloody. While the two armies were contemplating
each other from the opposite banks,
my division was selected, not to prevent Wallace
from driving us out of Maryland, but to drive
him from our front. My movement was down
the right bank of the Monocacy to a fording
place below, the object being to cross the river,
and then turn upon the Federal stronghold. My
hope and effort were to conceal the movement
from Wallace’s watchful eye, until my troops
were over, and then to apprise him of my presence
on his side of the river, by a sudden rush
upon his left flank. But Gen. McClausland’s
Cavalry had already attacked a portion of his
troops, and he discovered the movement of my
division before it could drag itself through the
water and up the slippery banks. He at once
changed front, and drew up his lines in strong
position to meet the assault. This movement
presented new difficulties. Instead of finding
the Union forces still facing Early’s other divisions
beyond the river, giving my isolated command
the immense advantage of a flank attack,
I found myself separated from all the Confederate
infantry, with the bristling front of Wallace’s
army before me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In addition to this I found other troubles
which mitigated against the success of my movement.
Across the fields through which we were
to advance, there were strong and high farm
fences which my men must climb while under
fire. Worse still these fields were full of grain
stacks so high and close together that no line of
battle could be maintained while advancing
through them. The movement began, and as my
men reached the first line of high fencing and
began climbing over, they were met by a tempest
of bullets, and many fell at the first volley.
They pressed on and around the grain stacks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>with no possibility of forming allignment or returning
effective fire. The men, deprived of the
support and strength of a compact line, pushed
forward and drove the Federals back to their
second line. The Union troops stood firmly in
this second position, bravely defending the railroad
and highway to Washington. Between the
two hostile lines there was a narrow ravine,
down which ran a stream of limpid water. In
this ravine the fighting was desperate and at
close quarters. To and fro the battle swayed
across the little stream, the dead and wounded
on both sides mingling their blood in its waters,
and when the struggle was ended a crimson
current ran toward the river. Nearly one-half
of my men fell there. Wallace’s army, after the
most stubborn resistance, was driven in the direction
of Baltimore. The Confederate victory
was won at fearful cost, but it was complete, and
the way was opened for Gen. Early’s march to
Washington.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 12th day of July Companies A and
F under marching orders, left Fort No. 1 and
Baltimore for Washington City, where we arrived
early the next morning. We lay at the
depot until ten o’clock, when we were ordered
to “fall in” and with the balance of the Regiment
marched up Pennsylvania Ave., greeted by
the cheers of the crowds who lined the sidewalks
and filled the windows of the buildings. We
marched past the White House and the Treasury
buildings. At the latter we saw President Lincoln
on the steps waving his high hat as we
marched by. We went over into Georgetown,
where, after a short rest, we joined the 19th
Corps in the chase of Early, who, after being
repulsed at Fort Stephens retreated to the Shenandoah
Valley. We marched to Edwards Ferry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>on the Potomac, which we forded about five
o’clock in the evening. Disrobing, we tied our
clothes around our guns, and at “right shoulder
shift arms” entered the water. It was an amusing
sight to look up and across the river, at the
boys struggling through the water. It was about
waist deep and some current. The rocks on the
river bottom were slippery, and every little while
a boy would go down, gun, clothes and all under
water, to struggle on again amid the cheers and
laughter of his comrades. But we finally all
crossed over and we were told not to dress until
we had forded Goose Creek which entered the
Potomac a short distance ahead. Early in his
haste to get away had burned some of his wagons
on the road, and we, in our bare feet had to pick
our way carefully through the ashes, which were
still glowing. It was amusing. We camped that
night on the banks of Goose Creek. The next
morning early the march was resumed and we
went into camp at Leesburg, Va., where we
rested the balance of the day and night. We
were ordered to guard the wagon train, and by
easy marches reached Snickers Gap on July 17.
Our train was halted about a mile back of the
Gap and our Regiment camped on a mountain
side.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>Cattle in the Corn.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>While resting in the camp on this mountain
slope, from which the corn fields stretched away
for miles, the army cattle were driven up, the
fence bars were let down and the cattle turned in
to a large field, beautiful in its waving green
product. In one hour’s time that field looked
like new ploughed ground, not a green blade was
left. The army advanced to the Gap, and in
crossing the ford the enemy opened fire upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>them, and a brisk engagement followed. From
our position we could hear the cannon and see
the smoke of the battle. This continued until
sunset. We were ordered out on picket, and took
our posts in the woods, being cautioned to keep
a sharp outlook. Our troops began to fall back,
and our second sergeant brought in the pickets
exclaiming in breathless haste “The army is cut
to pieces and in full retreat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course we hurried back into ranks, drew
forty rounds of cartridges, and, guarding the
wagon train started on the “double quick” for
Washington. This was at nine o’clock at night.
We marched without a stop until eight o’clock
the next morning, when we halted at Leesburg.
That night in passing through burning pine
woods the train was fired upon from ambush
and some were wounded. During this hard
night march the men walked along nearly asleep
on their feet, and if there was a temporary halt
they dropped in the dusty road, asleep instantly.
After a short rest at Leesburg we pushed on and
went into camp near “Chain Bridge” at Washington.
We arrived at night, completely worn
out from our long forced march. The Regiment
stacked arms, spread blankets on the ground and
lay down to sleep. We lay upon our gum blankets
and covered with the woolen ones. During
the night it turned quite cool and rained hard.
We were soaked through when we awoke in the
morning. We started fires, made coffee, ate some
hard tack, then wrapping our blankets around
us, sat down in the mud to silent meditation. It
rained hard until about noon, then began to
break away. By night it was clear and we had
a good sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning, July 21st, we drew new
shoes, formed ranks, crossed the bridge and followed
the Sixth Corps who were just breaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>camp as we came up. We marched through
Maryland via Rockville to the battle field of
Monocacy, which we passed over. We saw there
the signs of the fierce fighting, the high fences
full of bullet holes, and the grain stacks that obstructed
Gordon’s advance. We forded the river
and marched on through Frederick city.
Some of the boys of Company A at this point
“straggled” and slept in the fields just beyond
the town. They came up with the regiment the
next day in time to draw rations, and resumed
the march until we reached Harper’s Ferry.
Somewhere on this march an incident occurred
that made an impression upon my mind that I
will never forget. I call it</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>The Negro Cabin in the Vale</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The army had halted at noon for a little rest
and dinner. Four of us, comrades, went into
the woods in search of berries. Pushing along
through the pines we came to a deep valley in
which was a little clearing and a small log cabin.
A tiny brook flowed down the vale, and the dark
pine woods shut in a scene of beauty. It was the
home of a negro family, who were all out in
front, listening to the banjo played by one of our
colored teamsters. He was a fat, oily, good
natured fellow, black as ink. Seated on a stump
with his eyes rolling in ecstacy and a broad grin
showing his ivory teeth, he was an example of
the happy, carefree contraband of those days.
After listening awhile we passed on and after
getting some blackberries we returned the same
way. The family were seated at dinner and
when we looked in, saw the white table cloth
and the dishes, with the family and the banjo
player seated around the table, eating, our
mouths watered and we wished we could sit with
them. Thoughts of home and of our friends, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>their tables in the distant north, filled our minds
as we made our way back to the dusty turnpike
and again took up the weary march. This scene
was an oasis in our desert of dust, and its memory
is pleasant.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>The Negroes</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>While marching one hot, dusty day, a little
negro boy, about ten years of age, came out from
a farm house and walked along with us, on his
road to freedom. After marching awhile he became
very thirsty and appealed from one soldier
to another for a drink of water. He was refused
by several but his thirst increased and he became
desperate. Rolling his eyes in agony, with the
tears streaming down his cheeks, he exclaimed,
“Please sir! for the love of God, Massa, give dis
heah poor nigga a drink of water.” We could
not withstand such an appeal so we gave him a
drink from our canteen. I suppose he became
tired and went back home where there was plenty
of water, at least we heard no more of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>We did not see many negroes during our
service. They hid away when the army passed.
Occasionally we would catch a glimpse of a colored
woman peeping from a door or window
grinning at us. Two boys came back with us
from Virginia. By passing as body servants we
brought them through to Chillicothe. One was
a black, ignorant fellow, by the name of Henry.
He was about town for several years, employed
as a hosler. The other was a bright mulatto, intelligent
in conversation, but unable to read or
write. He was anxious to get an education. We
afterward heard of him as a school teacher near
Chillicothe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The negro could always be depended upon
to assist Union soldiers in their efforts to escape
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>from prison, and they approached their cabins
with confidence, knowing that they would give
them shelter and share their last morsel of food
with him, and guide him along his way. Many
a weary, hungry soldier has blessed the memory
of his kind benefactors, with black faces and
white hearts. This was the experience of our
two boys, Cook and Martin, who escaped from
Mosby, and has been the experience of hundreds
of others, who, escaping from the prison pens of
the south with the north star as a guide made
their way through rugged mountains and trackless
forests, back to “God’s country.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From Frederick, the army marched on to
Harper’s Ferry. Crossing the “Pontoon bridge”
we passed through the town and went into camp
at Halltown. We reached this camp on July 23d
and remained there two days. The Sixth and
Nineteenth Corps having passed up the Shenandoah
Valley in pursuit of Early. Gen. Crook’s
forces engaged Early at Kernstown, but losing
heavily, had been forced back to the Potomac.
This reverse caused our forces to fall back to
Maryland Heights. On July 25th our Regiment
“fell in” on the left and began what is known
as the terrific “hot march” The sun was blistering,
the heat seemed concentrated in the valley,
while the dust rising in clouds was suffocating.
As we plodded along on this short march of four
miles, men could be seen dropping from sunstroke.
I saw an officer throw up his hands and
fall backward off his horse. Comrades pulled
them to the roadside and did what they could
for them. It was reported that thirty-five men
had suffered sunstroke on that hot afternoon.</p>

<p class='c007'>We crossed the Potomac and began the ascent
of Maryland Heights, arriving at the summit
about sunset. The view from the top of the
mountain was grand. Tier after tier of blue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>mountains fading away in the distance, while a
rebel wagon train moved slowly up the valley,
shrouded in a cloud of dust that looked like it
was a mile high. That night there came a welcome
shower. The next morning we were
ordered down and again took up the march back
to Monocacy junction. Our Commanding General
Kenley made the remark, “the boys were
taken to the top of the mountain to see the sun
set.” We arrived at the junction in the evening
and rested. In the mean time our officers heard
of the second invasion of Pennsylvania. General
McClausland with a body of Confederate Horse
crossed the river and pushed on to Chambersburg
where he made a demand upon the citizens for
the sum of $500,000, threatening that if it was
not paid to burn the place. It was impossible
for them to raise this amount of money so he
fired the city, reducing it to ashes. This was one
of the most cruel, wanton acts of the war, perpetrated
upon defenceless citizens. While we were
rushing frantically up and down the valley of
the Shenandoah trying to find Early, his forces
were marching through Pennsylvania marauding
at their leisure. At this time Gen. Grant came
over from Washington to consult with his Generals
in regard to the situation. While standing
on the station platform I heard the following
conversation between Generals Grant and Hunter.
Grant said, “General Hunter, where is the
enemy?” Hunter replied, with a tremor in his
voice, “I don’t know, General.” At this Grant
in anger, exclaimed, “Move your troops back to
Harper’s Ferry, cut off his line of retreat and
you will find out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Orders were immediately given to return
to the Ferry and the infantry boarded a freight
train and were rushed back to Harper’s Ferry.
McClausland in the meantime retired from his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>raid and escaped to the south. We marched to
our old camp ground at Halltown, arriving there
July 28th. We remained quietly here for two
weeks. During this time our boys, taking advantage
of a well earned rest, engaged in all
kinds of pranks and amusements. We were paid
off while here so we had some money. The most
striking event occurring here was</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>The Wreck of the Sutler</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Sutlers, driving out from Baltimore, followed
in the wake of the paymasters, striking
the camps when the boys had money, would sell
their wares at very high prices. A sutler drove
up to the camp and had a lively trade all day.
He was finally ordered to move on by our officers
and toward dusk drove off. He was followed in
the dark by a squad from the Sixth Corps and
three boys of Company A. His outfit was new,
with a fine team of horses. He drove along unconscious
of danger. As he began to pull up a
hill with a high bank of a creek on one side,
the soldiers quietly unscrewed the nuts of the
axletrees on that side, and horses, wagon and
driver rolled over into the creek. That night the
camp was full of delicacies, hams, cheeses, cakes,
cans of condensed milk, etc., all hidden in convenient
bushes. The sutler made a great ado
about it but the soldiers were all so innocent
when brought before the officers that the sutler
could not fix the blame upon any particular ones,
so he was advised to return to Baltimore as
quickly as possible. He went.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this time dissatisfaction with Hunter’s
policies became acute, and he tendered his resignation.
Gen. Grant had for some time been contemplating
organizing a new department to be
known as the Army of the Shenandoah with Gen.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Phil. Sheridan at its head. Fears had been felt
that Sheridan was too young for such an important
position. Grant, however, had confidence
that the right man had been found for the place.
Accordingly Sheridan was placed in command
on August 7th and at once began organizing his
army. General Sheridan’s force consisted of the
Sixth Corps, one division of the Nineteenth
Corps and two divisions from W. Virginia under
Crook, with Averell’s and Torbett’s divisions of
Cavalry. The Sixth Corps was commanded by
Major Gen. Horatio G. Wright, an engineer of
high reputation but one of the few engineers who
had shown marked competency for a high command
in the field. The divisions of this Corps
were commanded by those splendid officers, Gens.
Geo. W. Getty, David A. Russell and James B.
Ricketts. Gen. William H. Emory was in command
of the Nineteenth Corps. Brigadier Gen.
George Crook commanded the two small divisions
which represented the army of West Virginia.
Brigadier John C. Kenley’s independent brigade
consisted of the 144th and 149th Ohio, the
3d Maryland Infantry, and Alexander’s battery
of Light Artillery. It was an imposing army of
young men, numbering 30,000 Infantry and
10,000 Cavalry. On the 12th of August Sheridan
moved up the valley, passing along the road
near our camp. The General and his staff rode
at the head of the column. The cavalry came
next riding in columns of four, followed by the
Sixth and Nineteenth Corps, the army of West
Virginia and the Artillery. Our brigade was
detailed to guard the wagon train.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mere statement gives no idea of the
magnitude of this force, but when I say that it
took an entire day to pass our camp, the Cavalry
and Infantry in column of fours, some idea
may be had of the grandeur of this army. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>were moving against Early, for the authorities
at Washington had become tired of the harassing
raids of the rebels into the north through
the Shenandoah, which had almost become “the
valley of humiliation” to them. Our brigade
was distributed through the length of the train,
each company in charge of thirty wagons. The
day was pleasant when we started. We marched
through Charlestown where they had hung John
Brown. The place seemed deserted, the only
sign of life being a negro woman peeping at us
from a half closed door. We pushed on, we had
orders to make Winchester by the next morning,
for the army needed supplies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after dark, in spite of warning from
the officers, the men began to straggle, dropping
out of ranks; some were getting into wagons,
others climbing the fences and sleeping in the
fields, expecting to overtake their command by
morning. My chum, James Ghormley, and myself,
after marching until eleven o’clock at night,
concluded that we were too tired to go any longer
that night, and that a good sleep was just
what we needed. We were within two miles of
Berryville when this notion entered our heads.
When we awoke daylight was just visible, and
we hurried on to overtake our Regiment, expecting
to boil coffee at the first fire we came to. We
walked on and soon came to where the train had
“parked,” that is, had encamped for the night,
and were just pulling out. It has been said that
this stop was made without orders from our
officers, but that the rebels, riding along during
the night dressed in our uniform, saying they
were aids, had given these orders, their object
being to cut off the train and attack it for plunder.
Our little squad soon came to where a company
of the 144th Ohio were cooking breakfast.
We asked permission to boil coffee at their fire.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>This was readily given. We stacked arms, and
our coffee had just come to a boil when “bang!
bang!” came two artillery shots at us, scattering
the limbs of the trees above our heads. These
shots were followed by a volley from a clump of
woods. Then they charged, yelling as they came.
They were Mosby’s Guerrillas, 400 strong, made
up of raiders, who disbanded when too hardly
pressed and became the innocent farmers of the
valley. We grasped our guns, leveled them over
the stone wall, gave them one volley, when the
Captain in command gave the order to scatter
and save ourselves. Well, we ran. In the confusion
Ghormley and I became separated and I
saw him no more. I was with the most of the
company going up a steep lane toward a farm
house, about half a mile from the road, passed
through a patch of corn and an orchard, and
came to the house. A man was sitting on the
porch, and he told me to run to the barn. I
took his advice. The barn was a mow on stilts,
open on every side, and stood on high ground.
I stopped for a moment and looked over the
field. The raiders were shooting our men down
in every direction. I climbed into the hay mow.
If I hadn’t this story would never have been
written. Like the Irishman who was asked if he
run at the battle of Bull Run. “Shure I did,
them that didn’t run are there yet.” The fight
was hot for a little while, but Mosby hurried for
fear of the army ahead. He captured 200 prisoners,
600 head of cattle and burned 70 wagons.
He expected to get the paymaster, who was with
us, with money for the army. The paymaster
was shrewd; he had packed the money in a
cracker box and placed it in a wagon, keeping
his strong box in his own vehicle. During the
fight this cracker box was tumbled down the
banks of a little creek that ran through the field.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>I saw it lying there and after the skirmish the
paymaster came back and got it. This attack
was a complete surprise and was a great loss to
Sheridan’s army. I joined our boys who were
gathering together on the field. As I passed
through the house lot I saw lying on his face
the body of a handsome young lieutenant, who
was shot by one of our company. The ball
entered his forehead and scattered his brains.
He was Lieut. Eddy of Mosby’s men, a member
of one of the good families in Richmond, Va.
Gen. Mosby lamented his loss greatly, he being
one of his most trusted men. Our Colonel and
Adjutant came riding back in full gallop and
hastily reformed the men, formed a skirmish
line and scoured the field, picking up discarded
arms and compelling an old man who had come
to the field with a mule and cart, to pick up
what he could and to haul them on to Winchester.
We guarded the wagons that were left on
to Winchester, where we found the Regiment.
That night we slept on the stone pavements of
the town and on the next day were sent out on
picket, south of the town. We remained there
two nights and a day. On the 15th of August
we started on our return early in the morning.
Before starting Col. Brown made a speech to
the Regiment in which he berated them for
straggling in the enemy’s country, said “he
would punish severely any disobedience of his
orders.” We reached Berryville at noon and
camped at the farm where the fight had taken
place. Two wounded men of the 144th were
lying on the porch of the house. They informed
us that almost every man of their company
had been captured. The 144th lost 130
men in this engagement. Lieut. Eddy had been
buried in a shallow grave in one corner of the
house lot. We kept a sharp outlook for our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>missing comrades, hoping that they had made
their way back to Harper’s Ferry.</p>

<p class='c007'>On this return march occurred one of those
events that made an impression never to be forgotten.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>John Brown’s Body</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was nine o’clock at night on a beautiful
summer night. The moon shone brightly
through the dark pines on the mountains, and
glistened across the guns of the great army that
marched down the turnpike into old Charlestown.
The men were weary and foot sore from
their long marches and were swinging along
carelessly. Suddenly someone started singing
“John Brown’s body lies a moldering in the
tomb.” Companies, Regiments and Corps took
up the refrain, tired bodies straightened up,
and took step to the music. The grand chorus
rang out “Glory, glory hallelujah” until the
mountains gave back the echo “Glory, glory
hallelujah” as though the hosts of Heaven were
joining in the refrain “His soul is marching
on.” It was the song of triumph, and if the
spirits of the departed know of things on earth
surely the shade of old John Brown was gratified.
Here he was hung, and in the graveyard
his body was lying “Moldering in the tomb,”
but his soul was marching on in the ranks of
the thirty thousand soldiers who on that night
marched through Charlestown keeping step to
the grand chorus, “Glory, glory hallelujah.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We marched on and went into camp on
Bolivar Heights, near Harper’s Perry. Here
we were joined by John Cook and Jeff Martin
of Co. A, who had been captured by Mosby but
escaped the same day. They told us the story of
the capture, how the others had been taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>south and they had escaped. Mosby’s men
after gaining the shelter of the mountains began
to examine their plunder and stopped to
array themselves in new Union officers’ uniforms.
They were marching over a steep mountain
road, guarding prisoners, when a portion
of them stopped, while those in front passed on
out of sight. This left the road clear without a
guard in sight. The two boys took advantage
of the opportunity and made a break for liberty.
Down the mountain side they ran, stumbling
and falling, but straining every nerve for freedom.
They were not missed apparently, for the
rebels did not pursue them. For three days
they wandered through the mountains, only approaching
the negro cabins by night, where they
always found friends ready to feed them and
help them on their way. Finally they reached
Harper’s Ferry and waited until we came up.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two Regiments lay in Camp on Bolivar
Heights for five days. The time of our enlistment
had expired ten days before and now we
were a waiting orders for returning to Ohio.
We had served nearly four months and were
anxious to get back home. When Gen. Sheridan
read the application for our discharge he paid
us the greatest compliment we had in our experience.
He said “I did not know that I had
any hundred days men in my army, they are
all veterans.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It rained hard all the time we remained on
Bolivar Heights, but we did not care, we were
going home. At last orders came from headquarters
for our discharge. We were to report
at Camp Dennison for final muster out. Giving
three cheers we started for Harper’s Ferry on a
dark, rainy day. Here we found a train awaiting
us, which we boarded and at night pulled
out for Baltimore, getting there the next morning.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>We formed ranks and marched to the
Northern Central depot, and took a train for
home. We returned over the same route over
which we came, with the same accommodations.
We had another good supper at Pittsburg and
reached Columbus, Ohio, at noon. We left our
train, marched to Todd Barracks and remained
over night. The next day we rode to Camp
Dennison, were assigned to the same barracks
that we had left four months previously. Cooks
were detailed and we remained there a week,
until Aug. 30th, the officers making out payrolls,
discharges, etc. While there several citizens
of Chillicothe came to see us and we received
many boxes of good things to eat from
home. Several of the boys left camp, walked to
the next station and came up home, returning
to camp the next day. To say that we were happy
but faintly expresses it. We were finally
discharged from the United States service and
paid off.</p>

<p class='c007'>A special train was furnished, cars with
seats in them, and we sped homeward. When
we arrived at Chillicothe we were met by a
large outpouring of the citizens, who, to music
furnished by the German Brass Band, escorted
us up town. We marched up Main street, and
we stepped proudly, but were saddened as we
passed the homes of James Ghormley and Edward
Armstrong. We were coming home, but
these, our friends and comrades, never returned.
They starved to death in Salisbury, N. C. prison
pen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The good people of Chillicothe had prepared
a dinner for us in the market house, and
we did justice to it. After dinner we “fell in”
for the last time, marched up Paint street and
drew up in front of the Court House, where
after a few remarks by the Colonel we broke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>ranks, each went to his home, and the 149th
Regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, became a
memory.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>My Capture and Prison Life</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><i>By William McCommon, Co. A, 149th O. V. I.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I was taken prisoner at Berryville, Va.,
on August 13th, 1864, at 4 A. M., together with
James Ghormley, Edward Armstrong, Eldridge
Whipple and George Fix, with one man by the
name of Sayre of Co. P. These are all that I
can recall now. We were cooking coffee by the
roadside when all at once we heard the report
of a cannon and the shell burst just over our
heads and came down through the branches of
the trees we were under. At that moment four
hundred of Mosby’s mounted guerrillas came
down on us demanding our money, watches,
jewelry or anything else of value we had on our
person. I had one dollar and forty cents. They
told me to give them the dollar and I could keep
the forty cents, as I would need that before we
got back, which I found was the gospel truth.
That rebel was honest, anyhow.</p>

<p class='c007'>They ordered us each to mount a mule and
carry a six pound shell in each hand until we
crossed the Shenandoah river and then they
would provide some other way to carry them.
I was riding a small mule and when about the
middle of the stream myself, mule and shells
dropped into a hole, and the shells are now lying
on the bottom of the Shenandoah river.
When we got across a rebel sergeant asked me
where my shells were. I told him I did not
know. He replied “I will report you to Col.
Mosby and you will have to pay for them.”
That would be the first whack at my lone forty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>cents. I heard no more about it until noon,
when they drew us up in line to count us. The
sergeant asked “who is you all men that lost
the shells in the river?” Nobody knew anything
about any shells and he did not recognize
me. He said to me, “You look like the man”
but of course I did not know anything about his
old shells. That is the last I heard of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our dinner the first day was one loaf of
bread cut in four pieces for four men. I can
say that none of us had to let out our trouser
straps. We marched thirty miles the first day
and were pretty well tired out by night, when
they issued to each of us one pint of flour. This
we mixed with water and slapped it on a flat
stone, which we propped up opposite the fire
and baked it. This tasted good to us but I am
afraid it would not pass muster at the Waldorf
Astoria. Armstrong said he could not eat his
without butter, but we told him his complexion
would be better if he would abstain from butter.
Finally he concluded that we were right and let
it go at that. A Lieutenant came along and
asked how we were making out. We told him
that we were perfectly delighted with the menu.
He said “I am glad you have nothing to complain
of.” The next day’s ride took us to Culpepper
C. H., the bracing air of Virginia still
keeping our appetites in fine shape. No breakfast
this morning but had a bounteous feast at
noon. They cut a loaf in two for two men. It
tasted good while it lasted but the time seemed
so short.</p>

<p class='c007'>That afternoon Ghormley said he was going
to make a break into the bushes and get away.
He jumped off his mule and had not gone more
than ten feet from the road when a guard spied
him and fired six shots into the bushes, when
Ghormley came back in a hurry. He told the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>guard that he only wanted to get some blackberries.
He watched him closely after that and
told him “the next berries <i>you</i> get will be lead
berries.” At the end of the third day we
reached Lynchburg, Va., where we were put
into an old tobacco warehouse. There were
three hundred prisoners there when we arrived.
We were quartered on the dirty floor, covered
with tobacco dust. You could hear the men
sneeze in all languages. Our fare was still one
loaf of bread for two men. At this place our
largest and strongest man, Henry Benner, a
wagon maker from Chillicothe, said “Boys, we
will never get out of this alive.” He began to
weaken right there, and in three weeks from
that time he died of home sickness. We tried
to shame him out of it, saying, “You are the
healthiest man in the bunch and you will live
through it if any one will.” One morning I
found him lying dead on the ground, the first
one of our little party to go. They kept us at
this place for four weeks and then moved us to
Richmond, Va. As we marched past Libbey
Prison we heard some one calling from an upper
window, “Hey! there! old 149th.” It was
Major Rozell who had been captured the same
morning that we were. In the fight at Berryville
the Major was wounded in the elbow and
had been taken direct to Libbey. We were not
allowed to speak to him and I have never seen
him since. I hear that he is still living in Missouri,
having received a letter from him some
time ago.</p>

<p class='c007'>We remained in Richmond one night, when
they took us across the river to Belle Island,
where the hardest part of our prison life began.
It was a bleak spot, bare of trees. Some few of
the prisoners had tattered tents, the majority
had none. It rained every day while we were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>there and the fog was so thick you could almost
cut it until about noon, when it would fix for
another rain. We had no protection whatever
from this weather, and we would walk around
in the night in the rain until we fell asleep on
the muddy ground. We would lie there until
awakened by the intense cold, to get up and
walk again. Here they fed us on wild pea soup,
flavored with ox tail, without dressing. No
napkins went with this course, and the meals
were never on time, as it took the cooks an hour
or more to skim the maggots off the soup, as
they wanted our meals to come to us perfectly
clean, so we could not tell our folks at home
that they did not understand their business.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here is where Armstrong told us “Boys we
are never going to make it.” We answered
“Now you commence and you will go like Benner.”
All the sick men at Belle Isle were to be
transferred to City Point, an order having been
issued to that effect. Whipple was not feeling
well so I told him that I would try to get him
off on the boat. I told him as we neared the
boat for him to fall down and I would call
the officers attention to him. As we had not
rehearsed the part, he fell down too soon. I said
“You fell down too soon. Wait until I give the
word and then fall.” We came near making a
mess of it, as it was. He began to laugh about
the time for him to fall, but the officers did not
see him laugh. The doctor asked me “what is
the matter with that man?” I told him “I
did not know but he was awful sick.” He finally
passed him to City Point. I heard after getting
home that he got as far as Annapolis, Md.,
and had died there. I fully expected to see him
when I got home, as I knew the others were
dead. He was a baker by trade and worked in
Chillicothe before his enlistment. We remained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>for seven weeks on Belle Isle, when we were
sent to Salisbury, N. C. We thought Belle
Island was awful, but this place, no man can describe
it, only an ex-prisoner of war. The
stockade, I think, contained twenty acres and
was fenced with trees split in half, with several
large gates. A large brick building occupied
part of the ground, which was formerly the
North Carolina Penitentiary. It had three
stories, the upper story, when we were there,
being used as a jail for rebel deserters and other
outlaws from the rebel army. If there ever
was a more villainous looking set of men, I
never saw them. The first night I was there I
went up to this third story to sleep, as it was
raining hard, not knowing anything about the
place. A man came to me and asked me if I
knew what kind of a place I was in? I told him
I did not. He said “get out of here as quietly
as possible or they would throw me out of the
window.” I went instanter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within a month Ghormley and Armstrong
both died. I was going around the grounds one
morning (we had long lost all dates) when I
saw Edward Armstrong lying dead on the
ground. I scarcely recognized him, he was so
black from stooping over the little pine knot
fires. The dead wagon carried him away.</p>

<p class='c007'>About a week later James Ghormley died.
I was talking with him the night before. He
said “I cannot last but a day or two.” I tried
to cheer him up but it was of no use. This left
me the only one of our boys alive that I knew
of. The last I saw of Armstrong and Ghormley
they were piled on the dead wagon that
came in twice a day to collect the dead. The
corpses were piled in, one on top of another like
so many logs, taken out and buried in trenches.
I remained there three months longer and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>just about ready to give up when one morning
a rebel lieutenant came to me and said, “Here,
you cussed Yank, get up to the gate, you are
to be exchanged.” I told him that was an old
story. He said “stay there then.” I told him
I could not walk so he had me carried to the
gate. There were a thousand loaves of corn
bread lying on the ground. They told each man
to take a loaf, as that would have to last us until
we got into our lines. We were three days
getting to the Union lines and our loaves looked
very small when we arrived at Wilmington, N.
C., where we were exchanged.</p>

<p class='c007'>We ran in on a foggy morning. One of
our boys cried out “there is our flag.” You
cannot realize how we felt, how we tried to raise
a feeble cheer, when we knew that we were in
God’s country once more. We were ordered to
“pile off” which we did in short order. There
were piles of broken crackers and scraps of
meat lying on the ground, which had been
tramped upon by men and horses, and we began
to eat it greedily until we were stopped by our
officers putting a guard around us. They told
us not to eat that garbage, as Uncle Sam’s rations
would be ready in a few minutes. It
seemed like a dream to us, we were in a heaven
of happiness. We were kept in a hospital at
Wilmington for about a week, and then we were
sent to Annapolis, Md., by transport. At Annapolis
we were put in tent hospital after burning
all our clothes and the “varmints” that
went with them. They then cut our hair close,
turned the hose on us, gave each man a good
scrubbing and clothed us in <i>night gowns</i> as our
uniforms had not arrived from New York. We
remained in hospital for two weeks, when we
were sent to general hospital at Baltimore, Md.,
where our record was taken. My weight at that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>time being 85 lbs., having lost 75 lbs. in rebel
prisons, I could not well spare any more. I remained
in hospital at Baltimore three months
longer, when I was discharged and sent home.
My own mother did not know me until I told
her who I was.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Note by George Perkins</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Comrade McCommon in his wonderful record
states that he does not know the dates on
which his comrades died. The records show
that James Ghormley died December 24th, 1864,
so counting back, Armstrong must have died
about December 17th.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our boys are sleeping in unknown graves,
but the government for which they died is not
unmindful of them. Among the most noteworthy
mementoes of the war is the memorial obelisk
erected at Salisbury, N. C. to mark the burial
place of the Union soldiers who perished in the
adjacent prison pen. It has been estimated
that eighteen trenches contain no fewer than
11,700 men, buried promiscuously, without the
possibility of identification, from which circumstance
this ground is known as the cemetery of
the unknown dead. It lies about a half mile
from the town of Salisbury on a sloping ground,
and has an extent of about seven acres, surrounded
by a massive stone wall. The cemetery
proper contains about two acres, the other five
being a lawn covered with trees. A neat lodge
has been erected at the entrance over which our
flag floats continually. The monument itself,
a plain obelisk of New Hampshire granite, thirty-six
feet in height, was erected at a cost of
ten thousand dollars. The unknown names of
the dead are poetically symbolized by a veiled
shield. A sword and helmet typify the conflict,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>and a pair of broken fetters the bursting of
prison bonds by death. Over all, surrounded by
a laurel wreath is the inscription “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pro Patria</span>.”
The monument, standing on the highest point
of the slope, forms a picturesque feature of the
local landscape.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As promised will write a few thoughts for
your book, but as I will have to depend entirely
upon memory, it may be imperfect.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a regiment, we have reason to be proud
of our record, for there were regiments of one,
two and even three years that did less real service
than did the 149th O. V. I. one hundred
day men. Our day’s work on right of Wallace’s
little army on the 9th of July, ’64, at Monocacy,
guarding the right flank of the army at Stone
Bridge on Baltimore pike, resulted in more
good than many other victories, as we helped to
hold Early’s thirty thousand men one day, and
this enabled Wright and Emery to reach Washington
and save the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>The regiment on that May morning in 1864
left their business and farms at great sacrifices
financially and otherwise, and went at call of
Governor to Camp Dennison as O. N. G’s. and
there volunteered for one hundred days as O.
V. I. How proud I was of those noble boys, as
we marched out that sunny May morning in
front of Governor Brough in our blue uniforms,
and arms glistening in the sun, keeping step to
the music—listened to a short speech from the
Governor—then heard the words “All who will
volunteer in U. S. service for one hundred days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>step four paces to the front;” every man in the
regiment stepped proudly to the front and was
mustered in as 149th O. V. I. Grant in his
history gives the author of “Ben Hur” great
credit for his work at Monocacy, and Wallace
complimented Col. Brown for work of his regiment.
Well we had a weary tramp back to
Baltimore—those of us who got back. From
there we immediately took the train for Washington,
and then it was tramp, tramp, tramp, up
and down, back and forth, until “Little Phil,”
(as he was affectionately called) came up and
things began to move.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those were trying times and many a brave
and patriotic boy became discouraged—but Gen.
Sheridan soon cleaned up things in the “Valley,”
although in doing so many brave boys lost
their lives, and among the number were quite a
good many of the 149th.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of us remember a little “scrap” with
Mosby at Berryville on an early morning (the
13th of Aug., ’64); I have only to look at my
left arm to remind me that a rebel bullet went
crashing through that arm and paralyzed it for
the time, and had to grab rein of bridle with
sword hand, but was soon surrounded by
“Johnnies” and started for the “sunny” south.
I might mention many incidents that would interest
some of the boys, had I time and space,
but as comrade McCommon is giving a paper
on prison life, and was along, will leave that to
him, but will add only that I was separated
from the “boys” at Lynchburg, and never saw
them more, except as they passed “Libby” a
few days later.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was in luck to get out about a month later
and home about a month after the regiment got
back. I had, while in three year service, been
shot through left lung, in right shoulder and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>face, and was discharged in the summer of 1863.
The wound received at Berryville was enough to
place me in what was called the hospital in Libby,
and an order was made to examine inmates
of hospital, and all who were considered permanently
disabled were ordered paroled; I “fell
back” on old wounds, and got out on that
order; a very happy man I was, when at Aiken’s
landing, I passed from under the rebel flag into
our lines and under the “stars and stripes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Long years have passed since those trying
times—many of the dear boys never lived to get
back—some sleep on field of battle at Monocacy—some
at Berryville, and some at southern
prisons; many have answered the last “Roll
Call” since their return home; but a few weeks
since I witnessed the burial of a member of Co.
F, a dear and only brother; soon all of us will
have to answer the final call. I am, with one
exception, Lt. Col. West, the only Regimental
officer left and almost all of the Company officers
are gone, and a large per cent of the boys
in the ranks are gone; Taps to all will come
soon, and Lights out forever. Let us be ready,
boys, for the “Grand Review” on the other
shore.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>An Incident in the Unwritten History of the Rebellion</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In that portion of the Civil War history
pertaining to the events in and around the city
of Washington D. C. which occurred during the
month of July, 1864, it will be shown that the
Capitol was besieged as it were, by a rebel force
under the command of the Confederate General
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Early, and known as “Early’s raid on Washington.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A true account of the prominent part taken
by the 149th Regiment O. V. I. in the defence of
the Capitol will be found in the foregoing pages
of this book, written by a comrade and member
of Company A of said Regiment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The writer of the following incident and a
witness to the same, had the honor to hold a
Commission, and in command of a company in
the Regiment, and having been detailed by the
General to store the surplus baggage of the Brigade
of which our Regiment was a part (this
preparatory to forced marches incident to the
aforenamed campaign of defense) was on duty
in the city when martial law was declared and
was placed in charge of a company of Treasury
Department Employees, and reported with the
company out on Arlington Heights, and were
assigned to a position behind the breast works
previously thrown up, every sort of fighting
force having been pressed into service for the
city’s defense.</p>

<p class='c007'>The necessity demanding it, for be it understood
that the Confederate army under General
Early was encamped uncomfortably near the
city, and plainly in view from the U. S. signal
station on the Heights.</p>

<p class='c007'>The anxiety of the great president (Mr.
Lincoln) for the safety of the Capitol was evidenced
when he insisted in being taken to the
very out post of the army in defense, giving
a word of cheer to the soldiery as he passed
along from one post to another, the president
himself being actually under fire, as occasionally
a bullet from the enemy’s sharpshooters would
whiz past.</p>

<p class='c007'>General Ord in command urged his retirement
to a place of safety, and finally under protest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>was about to enter his carriage, (his military
escort in waiting) his attention was attracted
to a young calf tied to a tree near a farm
house seemingly in great distress. This earth
work be it remembered at this time was built
through a lawn surrounding a farmer’s house,
and after the close of the war bought by the
Government and is now the National “Arlington
Cemetery.” Mr. Lincoln’s great heart was
touched at the distress of the young animal, and
stepping from the carriage he was about to enter,
went to examine the cause, when it was
found that a small bullet had been imbedded in
the tail of the calf and bleeding from the fresh
wound. Mr. Lincoln taking out his pocket knife
cut the ball out, and with a gentle pat on the
back of the calf placed the ball in his pocket.
Being again advised to retire to safer quarters
he reluctantly boarded his carriage and was
driven back to the city amid the shouts of the
army.</p>

<p class='c007'>This incident, a piece of unwritten history,
proves the great sympathetic heart of the man.
That while under the excitement and anxiety
consequent on the danger of the besieged Capitol
of the Nation, and his own life endangered,
yet his sympathy and relief was extended to a
poor dumb animal. ’Twas this spirit manifested
and the ready relief extended to the boys
in blue that entitled him to be called so affectionately
“Father Abraham” by not only the
boys of the army but the whole loyal North.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through all dangers and discomforts consequent
in “War’s Alarms” ’twas the manifestation
of this kindness of heart, courage and sympathy
that won the hearts of his countrymen,
and made him the greatest American.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>Personal Experience of Wm. R. Browning of Company I, 149th O. V. I. at Monocacy and as a Prisoner of War</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I was captured July 9th, 1864 at the battle
of Monocacy, after fighting from early morn
until 4:30 P. M., when, being hard pressed and
nearly surrounded by the enemy, we received
orders for every man to save himself. This
order scattered our organization, and we broke
for the rear. The rebels were fast closing in on
us, leaving only one road open for our retreat.
I took that route to escape, and went through all
right, but many of the boys were captured before
getting through. I followed the main body
of the troops who were in full retreat toward
Baltimore.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will not go into detail in regard to the
capture of Philip Frank of my company, and
myself, by a body of rebel cavalry, and taken
back to Frederick, but will relate one incident.
The cavalry who had captured us, met the infantry,
who demanded of them, that they turn
over the prisoners to them because they had done
all of the fighting, and were entitled to take
charge of the prisoners. A fierce quarrel arose,
they drew guns on each other, and a fight was
about to take place, when a cavalry officer rode
up, ordered the infantry to march on, and the
cavalry to take us to the rear. After marching
a short distance they halted us and said that
they would have to give us up soon, and that we
would be searched when they turned us over,
and that as they had captured us, we were their
prisoners, it was their first search. They began,
and took away what we had, that they wanted,
combs, knives and some silver money that I
happened to have, but they did not get rich,
for we did not have much for them to get.  We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>marched back to Frederick City, and were halted
in the main street, where we were turned over to
the infantry. While there, some of the loyal
ladies of the town came with a basket of food,
and gave some to us, which tasted very good,
as I had only two hard tack and a pint of coffee
that day. They would not give our guard any
of it so they became angry and drove them away.</p>

<p class='c007'>While here, more prisoners were brought
in, and we marched through the town, and went
into camp for the night in a field outside the
limits. The next morning we marched back
through the town, and on about four miles to
Monocacy Junction. We passed through the
battle field, where the dead and wounded were
still lying on the ground, where they had fallen.
At the junction we were joined by five hundred
prisoners, who had been captured and brought
there the night before. These men had drawn
two days’ rations from the rebels, but we did
not get anything. However, there was no help
for it, and we started on the Rockville road
toward Washington, passing through part of the
field of Monocacys battle of the day before.
Some of the wounded were lying by the road
side, and begged us piteously for water. My
canteen was filled with water, and I stepped
out of ranks to give the poor fellows a drink,
but a rebel guard drew his gun on me and swore
he would shoot if I did not get back into line.
I told him I only wanted to give the wounded
men a drink, when he said let some of the
Yankee citizens round here give them water.
At that, I took off my canteen and threw it over
to the wounded men. My guard at that said,
“I was a fool, and that I would need a canteen
before I got one.” This was true for I never
had another, but often needed one.</p>

<p class='c007'>We marched on to Rockville where dead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>horses were lying in the street. There had
just been a fight here. We went into an
orchard surrounding a house, and got water
from the well. A lady came out and said, “If
any of you boys want to write home, I will mail
your letters for you. The rebels will soon retreat,
and then I will send the letters.” Comrade
W. W. McCracken wrote a letter telling
our folks at home all the particulars of our
capture. He left the letter with the lady, and
it reached its destination.</p>

<p class='c007'>I told her I had no rations and that I was
very hungry, and wanted something to eat. She
gave me a big slice of home made bread and
butter. I will never forget that loyal lady,
and have often wished that I could go to Rockville
to repay the kindness done to a poor boy,
only fifteen years old, and a prisoner of war.
We were then taken out to another road on our
way toward Washington, and camped in a field
for the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning we resumed the march
toward Washington. About noon we began
to hear heavy firing in front, and the rebel
stragglers began passing us hurrying to the
front so that they might be among the first to
enter Washington and loot the city. One of
the guards told me that the roar of the cannons
was the sweetest music on earth to the rebels.
I answered, “I think before you take Washington
you will be accommodated with plenty of sweet
music.” We marched on for three hours under
heavy fire from siege guns. The stragglers
who had rushed to the front in order to be the
first to enter the city began to come back. We
taunted them, asking, “Why didn’t you go on
into Washington?” They replied, “We would,
only the cursed Yankees are throwing flour barrels
at us.”  We were marched up until in full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>view of Fort Stephens, where we could see the
stars and stripes floating above the fort.</p>

<p class='c007'>They placed us in an orchard so close to
the fort that the shells would crash through the
tree tops above our heads. This was not of
long duration, until a rebel line of infantry
came out of the woods and charged the fort.
The fort reserved their fire until the rebels got
close up to it, and I began to fear that it would
be taken, when all at once it let loose with artillery,
and a galling infantry fire from a line of
troops that we had not seen. Such a noise I
never heard. The smoke and the gathering
twilight hid all the combatants from view, but
we could tell from the sound of the guns that
the rebels were falling back, and that the Union
infantry was following them up. Directly all
firing ceased, and we knew that the enemy had
been repulsed. At this time we drew two days’
rations of beef and flour, but before we had
time to cook it we were ordered to fall in, and
under a heavy guard began marching to the
rear. The whole rebel army came pell mell,
almost a stampede. The cavalry and artillery
filled the road, the infantry going through the
fields. The cattle they had stolen in Maryland
were also driven through the fields, the drivers
yelling and swearing, making the air hideous
with the din. A fine residence of a United
States Senator was burned to the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this made an impression upon my mind
that I will never forget. I learned afterward
that after their repulse at Washington, the word
was passed that General Hunter was advancing
from Harper’s Ferry to attack them in the rear.
We marched all night and forded the Potomac
at Edwards Ferry early the next morning. We
waded the river, which came up to my arm pits.
I being small.  We camped near a big spring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>not far from the river, where we rested and
cooked what little we had. The next morning
two days rations were issued, and cooked, and
we again took up the march passing through
Leesburg, Va., and on through Snickers Gap,
getting to the Shenandoah river after dark.
Here we camped for the night. The next morning
they allowed us to bathe in the river. We
resumed the tiresome march and pressed on to
Winchester where we halted in the edge of the
town. While here we drank from a spring the
coldest water I ever saw. We then marched to
Kernstown where we encamped for two days.
Here Joseph Rowland and Joseph Hays of my
company made their escape. This left eleven
of our squad still prisoners. Sergeants James
Nichols and Rees McCall; Corporals James and
William Harrison, brothers and Privates W. W.
McCracken, Thomas Broaders, Philip Frank,
Wm. Houser, James Cruit, Peter Garratt and
myself. The stop here gave us a much needed
rest, and we again drew our two days’ rations
of beef and flour. Two days’ rations may sound
big, but a hearty man could eat it all at one
meal without discomfort. I do not remember
the exact amount, but know that it was not near
enough to satisfy our hunger.</p>

<p class='c007'>We again resumed our march bound for
Staunton up through the beautiful Shenandoah
valley, passing through New Market, Mt. Jackson
and Willow Springs. At Staunton we
boarded the cars and rode to Charlotte. Here
we went into camp and drew what they called
rye bread and tainted salt beef. The bread
was the worst I ever saw. It was dough inside
with a thick hard crust, that could hardly be
broken, when it was broken the dough rolled
out. The next morning we were again taken
by the cars to Lynchburg.  Here we were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>placed in a tobacco warehouse. The floor was
covered with dried tobacco juice and licorice,
at least that was what the boys said it was. I
did not use the weed. We remained here a
few days, I don’t remember how long, I only
recollect the stinking meat issued to us.</p>

<p class='c007'>While here I passed my sixteenth birthday,
the 26th of July. On the 27th, we went on to
Petersburg and Richmond Junction, thence to
Danville, arriving there on the 28th. We were
assigned to Prison No. 7, an old tobacco warehouse.
The first floor was used as a hospital,
the second, third and fourth stories for prisoners
quarters. I was put in squad No. 7 on the
second floor. We were fifty men to a squad in
charge of a sergeant whose duty it was to draw
rations for the men and to detail two comrades
each day to carry water from the Dan river,
about 200 yards from the prison. Here the
hard prison life began. There was a cook
house near the prison, the cooks being Union
soldiers. The rations were corn bread made
of corn and cob ground together, sometimes
with salt, often without. Once in a while we
had bean soup made from black or nigger peas,
as they called them. A little bacon in the soup
full of skippers. I could not eat it, it was so
filthy, I only ate a small piece of the corn bread
each day.</p>

<p class='c007'>I cannot go into detail, each day was like another
and very monotonous. We suffered from
the heat when we first went into this prison.
There were five squads of 50 on our floor, and
when we all lay down at night, there was no
room to spare, we were packed like sardines in
a box. To economize space we would lie in
rows across the building and when we turned
over all would turn. On a hot night the stench
was fearful.  We remained here during July
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>and August using water from the Dan river.
This was stagnant, in pools, for the river had
almost dried up in the summer. The rebels
would march us past as nice a spring of good
cold water as ever flowed and would not allow
us to get it, but take us to the river, where we
skimmed the green scum from the surface with
our buckets and dip water from the hot, stinking
pool. The hot weather created thirst, and
the prisoners drank it as fast as it was carried
to them and cried for more. If our guards
were not in the humor we would have to wait
until they were ready, consequently there was
great suffering from thirst. About the last of
August, Smith Miller of Company E of our
regiment became suddenly insane, and was
taken to the hospital where he afterward died.
Philip Frank of my company was also sent to
the hospital where he died. Many of the men
became sick and we were all growing weaker
day by day. In September an order came to
exchange a certain number of the sick. When
the doctor came to examine them, I took Samuel
Jones to him, Jones could not walk, so Joe
Shepard and I carried him down. The doctor
passed him and then asked me, “Now what is
the matter with you?” I told him, “Nothing,
only I want something to eat.” The doctor
replied, “If you would say so, I will pass you.”
I said, “No, take some poor fellow that was
sick, I am not sick, and I do not intend to die in
prison.” The boys of my company that were
released at this time were James Nichols, Reeves
McCall, James and William Harrison and Peter
Garrett. The two Harrison boys died at
Annapolis, Maryland, on their way home.
Disease and exchange now cut our number
down, but our condition did not improve, we
were growing weaker every day for want of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>food. In October I was sick with diarrhoea
and went to the hospital. The sick were better
cared for, and the nurses were detailed Union
soldiers. The doctors were Rebels, and did
not have much regard for the prisoners. I
remained in the hospital but did not get any
better. In October Thomas Broades was brought
into the hospital, paroled on sick leave, and
afterward died at Annapolis. Later in the
year William Houser was brought over to the
hospital, but only lived a few days.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between Christmas and New Years Day I
took the pneumonia and the doctor told me,
“Well, little Yank, you will have to die,” I
told him, “I will never leave my bones in the
southern confederacy.” He put a fly blister
on my chest and the next morning I was better.
Then I had inflammation of the bowels, and he
swore I would die. He had no medicine to
give me, but put another fly blister on my
stomach. The blisters broke in the night and
the water run all over me. In the morning I
again felt better but soon erysipelas set in,
where the blisters had been. He then said I
must be painted with iodine. This the nurses
refused to do, saying that I would die, and did
not see the use of torturing me, but let the boy
die in peace. The doctor said it must be done.
They asked me about it, I told them if they
would let Edgar Hulbert of the Twenty-third
O. V. I. who was a nurse, paint me I would
never say a word. He did the job and I kept
my promise. About a week later I was up and
walking around. I improved rapidly, and on
the 25th of January I was returned to the
prison. About this time the United States
sent some clothing to us, but not enough to go
round. I drew a blouse and my comrade McCracken
a blanket.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>It was now very cold in the prison, some
would sleep under blankets while others
marched around to keep warm. We kept this
up until becoming exhausted, we would rouse
the sleepers and take their places. This was
kept up continually day and night, as long as
we remained at Danville. About the 10th of
February we were placed in the cars and carried
to Richmond, Va., and put in Libbey prison.
We suffered terribly from the cold on this trip.
We were weak and our clothes were worn out.
I was dressed in the blouse spoken of, remnants
of a pair of trousers and a pair of socks that I
had taken off a dead man. My pants were so
badly worn that I would not be presentable in
good society. But comrade McCracken had
his blanket and we snuggled under it in one
corner of the car and done the best we could
until we landed in Libbey.</p>

<p class='c007'>There has been a great deal said about
Libbey prison, and truly too, but it was the
best one I was in, we had a warmer place to
stay and a greater variety of food, although the
rations were extremely small. Here we talked
about being exchanged, we thought we had been
brought here for that purpose. On the morning
of February 20th, a Rebel officer came to
the prison and told us to get ready for parole.
There was a glad lot of poor boys, all was excitement.
The officer went away and did not
return until afternoon when he returned with
other officers and clerks and called us up in line.
We took the oath of parole to do no duty for
the United States Government until regularly
exchanged. This we gladly took. That night
we had a big time, nobody slept, in the morning
we were going back to God’s country and home.
Comrade McCracken sold his blanket for fifty
dollars (confederate) and bought six pounds of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>flour with it. We made flap jacks and baked
them on a stone, ate and talked about what we
would eat when we got home.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the morning we were taken on board the
rebel flag of truce boat, I was very weak, but Joe
Shepard the good Samaritan of our regiment
helped me aboard, and we started down the
James river to Harrison Landing. Some one
shouted “there is the old flag.” In an instant
everybody was alert, and on looking down the
river we caught a glimpse of “Old Glory”
through the tree tops on one of the boats of our
fleet. Such a time I never saw, we were the
happiest boys on earth. We cheered, we
shouted, we cried, we prayed, we were so happy.
Many were going back to die, but they were
glad to get where they could die under the dear
old flag. We landed at Harrison Landing
where the 25th Corps (colored) was stationed.
It looked queer to me to see them on the skirmish
line opposing the Rebels. Each fellow had his
“gopher hole” to dodge in, one big black fellow
picked me up like a baby and carried me back
through the lines. They all came running to
us with something to eat, those great black fellows
with white hearts. My man carried me as
far as he could go, and I walked a short distance
to the river, where the transport “New York”
was waiting for us. We went aboard and had
a good meal of soft wheat bread, pickle pork,
coffee with sugar and condensed milk, I
thought I had never tasted anything so good.
We arrived at Annapolis on Washington’s birthday,
February 22, 1865.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have tried in my own feeble way to tell
something about my prison life. I have written
it from memory and there may be some
errors of dates, and etc. An old man’s memory
is sometimes faulty.  I have not told of all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>horrors that I have witnessed, no tongue can
tell nor pen describe what I have seen in these
hells. To tell all would make a book, what I
have told is true. I was discharged March
29th, 1865, at Todd Barracks in Columbus, Ohio.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>Incidents</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>While we were in camp at Chain Bridge
we occupied the crest of a hill or ridge that
sloped gradually to the south, making an ideal
camping ground for the army. As night drew
on camp fires were kindled and twinkled by
thousands over the slope while the soldiers prepared
their supper. Stories of their adventures
and songs served to pass the evening. When
the time came for “lights out,” a drum corps on
the right began playing “The girl I left behind
me.” A brass band in the centre struck up
“Home Sweet Home.” These were all the
tunes we recognized, for every band and drum
corps in camp began playing. Pandemonium
seemed to have broken loose, as the great volume
of sound came up. Tunes could not be distinguished,
the discord was terrific. It gradually
died away as band after band ceased playing.
A deep silence came over the plain, the
stars blinked in the summer sky. The army
was asleep.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>Observation on the March.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Once on our march toward Snickers Gap I
saw a squad of soldiers taking a cow from a
farm lot, they had tied a rope around her horns
two were tugging at the rope, and others were
pushing.  The woman of the house and her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>children were crying and begging them to let
her alone. The argument was still on as we
marched along.</p>

<p class='c007'>On this same march we passed a field where
a fight had taken place a day or two before.
The dead had been buried and the wounded
removed, but the field was full of dead horses.
The stench from the swollen carcasses lying
under the sweltering rays of the hot July sun
was terrific. We hurried past as fast as possible,
breathing a sigh of relief when we came again
into the pure air of the mountains.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>Harper’s Ferry.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Harper’s Ferry was the gateway to the
south. It was captured and retaken many times
during the war by both Union and Confederate
armies. Situated at the confluence of the
Shenandoah and Potomac rivers, with Loudon
and Maryland Heights surrounding it, it was a
natural fortress. The town was the target for
both sides, and many of its homes carried the
marks of shot and shell. The United States
Arsenal which was burned early in the war,
stood with roofless walls and tottering chimneys
a silent monument of the ravages of the conflict.</p>

<p class='c007'>A pontoon bridge spanned the Potomac
river a short distance above the railroad bridge,
over which the armies passed. When we
marched across the pontoon, orders were given
to “break step,” least the swing of the time
step would break the bridge. This bridge was
laid on boats that were lashed together side by
side, and anchored in the river, on these
stringers were laid and a floor on the stringers,
rails were placed on the edge to keep the wagons
from slipping over. This, however did not prevent
some from going over, for I saw two wagons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>with their teams lying overturned on the bottom
of the river.</p>

<p class='c007'>While in the town we went into the old
engine house called “John Brown’s Fort” where
he put up his stubborn fight against the Virginia
militia. The loop holes through which he fired
were still there. Every time we passed through
this town was on a Saturday, so we nick-named
it “Harper’s Weekly.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>Shooting Deserters.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A chain of forts encircled Baltimore, Maryland,
from Fort No. 1 on Baltimore street to
Fort No. 12 in Druid Hill Park. Details were
made from the men at our fort for guard duty
at these outposts. One guard at each fort to remain
all day, his duty being to keep a strict
watch. One day, (I being on duty at Fort 11),
a squad of twelve cavalrymen came on a full
gallop down the road past the fort. Just as
they came opposite to where I was standing
guard, the officer in command shouted, “There
they are, fire.” A volley from their carbines
followed and two men who were in a field running
through the high wheat threw up their
hands and tumbled over dead. I heard afterward
that they were deserters trying to escape
from Lafayette Barracks. The discipline was
severe, some may think too much so, but it was
necessary in order to control the great variety
of characters that made up the army. When
our company first came to Fort No. 1 we found
the guard house full of rough men of the New
York Artillery, and we were detailed to guard
them. Of all low, rough New York toughs,
these were surely the worst. They took great
pleasure in guying the boys fresh from home,
and their actions were disgusting.  Luckily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>they went away in a short time. One night
two of them attempted to break guard and
escape. Our boys who were on guard fired at
them, and alarmed the garrison. A search
squad was at once formed and the two men were
found lying on their faces in the ditch surrounding
the fort, nearly frightened to death. They
were taken back to the guard house saying,
“they did not think the century plants would
shoot,” but they did. These fellows had a
better opinion of us after that episode.</p>

<p class='c007'>During our first march the boys began to
pick up from the fields various articles that
they considered valuable as relics, intending to
carry them home. Bayonets and cannon balls
seemed to be favorite articles for collection.
After carrying them for a few miles they began
dropping them one by one. We found out in
a very short time that the less we had to carry
the better we could march.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was fortunate in bringing home, and still
have my cap box, eagle plate, visor of my cap
a tin flask and testament and hymn book. A
testament and hymn book was given to every
soldier. But the most prized is the engraved
and engrossed card of thanks given by the president
of the United States, under seal of the
Government, and signed by the martyred friend
of every Union soldier, Abraham Lincoln. A
captain in our regiment brought home a beautiful
sword that belonged to one of Mosbys’ men,
and was found on the field after the fight at
Berryville, Va. It was a beautiful piece of
work, ivory hilt, gold mounted, with a scabbard
inlaid with gold and silver designs. It was
highly prized by the captain, and no doubt
would be more highly prized by the man who
lost it at Berryville.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>Conclusion.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The hundred days service was hard, but it
had a humorous side. Many were the pranks
played by the boys. Many pleasant hours we
spent together, and our experiences are told and
laughed over today. At Fort No. 1 we had
our own string band, and every evening we had
dancing or singing led by Captain Peabody or
Lieutenant McKee, some played cards, others
went down into the city taking in the markets,
theatres, etc. At one time down town a
gentleman asked some of us, “Boys, what regiment
do you belong to?” We answered, “The
149th Ohio.” He mused awhile and said, “One
hundred and forty nine, that means a hundred
and forty nine thousand, my goodness boys do
men grow on trees in Ohio?”</p>

<p class='c007'>When we left Baltimore our hardships
began, the first day’s march nearly used us up,
starting from Washington at noon, we crossed
the Potomac at Edwards Ferry at 5 o’clock, our
feet were blistered as we hobbled along, the first
night we sank to rest, a tired, discouraged body
of men. Our accoutrements were heavy, our
guns a burden, but a canteen filled with water
seemed heaviest of all, the string over the
shoulder felt like it would cut clear through.
Our appearance after two or three marches
would have made Rip Van Winkle on awakening
look like a dude in comparison.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were ragged, tattered and torn, our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>shoes worn out, and the sacred soil of old Virginia
was ground into our system, from the dust
that we continually lived in. We thought the
turnpikes of the Shenandoah valley were the
hardest in the world. But they were not too
hard to sleep on, when the weary soldier dropped
in his tracks, the moment a halt was made.
I have seen the men marching sound asleep
only awakened when their heads came in contact
with the tail board of the wagon in front.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was the common experience of all
soldiers and we did not complain, we often said
we would rather meet the enemy than to endure
the fatigue of the march.</p>

<p class='c007'>The events I have tried to describe happened
forty-seven years ago. Many who were
with us then have answered the last roll call
and passed over the majority. We who remain
keep their memory green by strewing their
graves with flowers on each recurring Memorial
day, while those of our comrades who are sleeping
in unknown graves in the south are not forgotten
in our annual tribute of flowers. Soon
the last old soldier will have gone to his rest,
but his work will endure in a restored Union,
a nation that commands the respect of the world.
We did what we could, man or angels can do
no more, we did not realize at the time in what
a great work we were engaged. I am glad
that I was permitted to live in those days, and
take a little part in the great events that
resulted in a reunited country, whose flag is
honored wherever it flies.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>149th Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry one hundred days’ service</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This regiment was organized at Camp
Dennison, O., from the 8th to the 11th of May,
1864, to serve one hundred days. It was composed
of the Twenty-seventh Regiment, Ohio
National Guard, from Ross county, and the
Fifty-fifth Battalion, Ohio National Guard,
from Clinton county. On the 11th of May the
regiment left the state of Baltimore, Md. Upon
arrival it was assigned to duty at various forts
in and around the city, and remained there
until the 29th of May, when it was ordered to
the eastern shore of Maryland, and distributed
at different points. About the 4th of July the
regiment was ordered to Monocacy Junction,
and on the 9th took part in an engagement with
the enemy. The regiment lost in killed and
wounded about thirty, and in prisoners over
one hundred. After the battle of Monocacy it
took part with the Sixth and Nineteenth Corps
in the marches in Maryland and Virginia.
Portions of the regiment were with the One
Hundred and Forty-fourth when it was attacked
by Mosby’s guerrillas, at Berryville, Va.,
August 13. The regiment returned to Ohio
August 20, 1864, and was mustered out on the
30th, on expiration of its term of service.</p>
